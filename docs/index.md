## The `MidMarkupReader` trait

Classes implementing the `MidMarkupReader` trait can read texts in some recognized form (perhaps following an XML markup schema, or following some convention in Markdown or other plain-text format), and parse them into the OHCO2 model according to the semantics of a specified type of edition.
